# Led-Diod-WIFi


Made a PHP MVC architecture and implemented the Flight API for the REST architecture.

Using ESP32 made the firmware to controle the built-in led diod with the press on the button on the website.

Made and endpoiint in witch you can see the led diod status in the database. When the button is presed it changes the value. The microcontroller reads the endpoint using Arduino Json and updates the led diod.
